# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Implementation-and-Comparison-with-SKLearn-for-Cross-Validation:

This project implements decision trees in two ways: from scratch and using the scikit-learn library. Two criteria, Gini index and entropy, were incorporated for attribute selection, alongside handling missing values.

The implementation was tested on two datasets, comparing model accuracy, F1, recall, precision, and runtime. Analysis in R included paired T-test, Friedman test, and McNemar's test for model comparison. Evaluation methods such as confusion matrix, ROC Curve, and AUC score were used to assess the models.

Final results from the analysis were derived, revealing the performance of our scratch implementation against scikit-learn.
